There are three steps when creating an object from a class:
* **Declaration** − A variable declaration with a variable name with an object type.

* **Instantiation** − The 'new' keyword is used to create the object.

* **Initialization** − The 'new' keyword is followed by a call to a constructor. This call initializes the new object.

Source File Declaration Rules:
* There can be only one public class per source file.
* The public class name should be the name of the source file.
* A source file can have multiple non-public classes.
