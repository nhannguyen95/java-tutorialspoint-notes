There are 2 data types available in Java:
* Primitive Data Types.
* Reference/Object Data Types.

8 Primitive Data Types:

|Data type|#Bits|Default value|Min|Max|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|`byte`|8|0|-128|127|
|`short`|16|0|-32,768|32,767|
|`int`|32|0|-2,147,483,648|2,147,483,647|
|`long`|64|0L|-9,223,372,036,854,775,808|9,223,372,036,854,775,807|
|`float`|32|0.0f|||
|`double`|64|0.0d|||
|`boolean`|1|false|||
|`char`|16||'\u0000'(0)|'\uffff'(65,535)|

**Reference Datatypes**: Reference variables are created using defined constructors of the classes. They are used to access objects. These variables are declared to be of a specific type that cannot be changed.

---

**Java Literals**: just the same as C++, some differences:
* `\ddd`: Octal character (ddd)
* `\uxxxx`: Hexadecimal UNICODE character (xxxx).
